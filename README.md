# Satisfiability-problem-solving

The so-called “SAT” satisfiability problem is classified as a decision problem which, given a propositional logic formula, determines whether there is an assignment of propositional variables which makes it satisfiable (true). SAT was shown to be an NP-complete problem by Stephan Cook in 1971.

SAT has a big place in artificial intelligence. The study of this problem and its variations has helped to point out the border between easy and difficult problems. The satisfiability of logical formulas places one on the side of problem solving, automatic reasoning and any other axis of AI where logic is needed. It is now used in many fields such as cryptanalysis, planning, bioinformatics, hardware and software verification ...

For several years now, SAT has been the subject of numerous works which have produced remarkable results on two levels: theoretical and practical. But despite its success, there is still a great demand for effective algorithms that can solve these difficult problems.

We are going in this project to test several methods which are either blind or informed (use a heuristic) namely "" Search by depth, Search by width, Search A * "" as well as evolutionary search algorithms for solving the satisfiability problem, namely ("genetic algorithm, ant colony optimization").


To run the project you need to:
1- Download and install Eclipse from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads (or use any other java IDE).
